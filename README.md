**Example case:** Bartender Server. üçª

Responsible for:

1. Providing a menu of drinks on a REST API
2. Collecting incoming orders from a message queue
3. Persisting orders in a database for bookkeeping
4. Collecting payment for orders using a payment-provider
5. Sending events to a topic when an order is ready

### Architecture

![component architecture](component-architecture.drawio.svg)

You can see that the 5 responsibilities also require 4 external systems (queue, database, topic),
and it provides a service for external users (REST-API).

We need end-to-end tests to have *some* confidence that our backend works with these external systems.
Mocking them in tests will not be good enough.

(For *real confidence*, you can go even further and create **system tests**, where you inject data into a real, deployed
AWS account as part of your CD-pipeline. This is out of scope for this course.)

#### Organization of code

The `Main`-file starts the application.
It loads a `Config` into an `App`.
The app starts serving the REST-API, and starts a `SqsPoller` to read from its SQS queue.

The API provides the output of `GetDrinkMenuRoute`.

The SQS poller loops forever, fetching new messages and sending them to a queue processor named `OrderQueueProcessor`.
The `OrderQueueProcessor` coordinates several services and persists to the database.
Then, an event is sent out using `OrderReadyNotifyer`.

## Getting started

### Tool dependencies

You need to install:

- Docker
- Maven (or run maven through IntelliJ)
- JDK 17
  - `brew tap homebrew/cask-versions` and then`brew install --cask temurin17`

### Developer machine setup

#### GitHub Packages

Create a personal access token (classic) with at least `packages:read` scope:
https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=packages:read .
Copy the generated token.

Add a token to maven ( `~/.m2/settings.xml` ) for GitHub Packages:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                      https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>github</id>
      <username>my-username-on-github</username>
      <password>123_abc-my-secret-token-here</password>
    </server>
  </servers>

</settings>
```

#### Git Clone

```shell
git clone git@github.com:krissrex/capra-e2e-testing-kotlin-backend-course.git
```

**IntelliJ** ‚Üí `File` ‚Üí `New` ‚Üí `Project from existing sources...` ‚Üí `capra-e2e-testing-kotlin-backend-course`.

Choose _"Import project from external model"_ and select `Maven`.

## Running the application

Start [Main.kt](src/main/kotlin/no/liflig/bartenderservice/Main.kt).
You should use `./build-and-run.sh`.

It needs a Postgres database, an SQS message queue, and an SNS pub/sub topic.

### Building a dockerfile (optional)

1. Build the jar: `mvn package`
2. Copy the jar from `target/app.jar` to `/docker/app.jar`.
  - You can use `cd docker && ./test-docker.sh`.
3. Run the app
  - Start `docker-compose`:
     ```shell
     docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
     ```
  - Or run `no.liflig.bartenderservice.Main.main()`
  - Or `cd docker && ./test-docker.sh`

You can test the API with [src/test/http/menu.http](src/test/http/menu.http)

## Running tests

```shell
mvn verify
```

Add `-DskipTests` to `mvn` to disable all tests.
Add `-DskipITs` to only disable integration tests.

## Linting

Only lint: `mvn spotless:check`

Fix: `mvn spotless:apply`
