**Example case:** Bartender Server. üçª

Responsible for:

1. Providing a menu of drinks on a REST API
2. Collecting incoming orders from a message queue
3. Persisting orders in a database for bookkeeping
4. Collecting payment for orders using a payment-provider
5. Sending events to a topic when an order is ready

### Architecture

![component architecture](component-architecture.drawio.svg)

You can see that the 5 responsibilities also require 4 external systems (queue, payments, database, topic),
and it provides a service for external users (REST-API).

We need an end-to-end tests to have *some* confidence that our backend works with these external systems.
Mocking them in tests will not be good enough.

(For *real confidence*, you can go even further and create **system tests**, where you inject data into a real, deployed
AWS account as part of your CD-pipeline. This is out of scope for this course.)

#### Organization of code

![code architecture](code-architecture.drawio.svg)

The `Main`-file starts the application.
It loads a `Config` into an `App`.
The app starts serving the REST-API, and starts an `SqsPoller` to read from its SQS queue.

The API provides the output of `GetDrinkMenuRoute`.

The SQS poller loops forever, fetching new messages and sending them to a queue processor named `OrderQueueProcessor`.
The `OrderQueueProcessor` coordinates several services and persists to the database.
Then, an event is sent out using `OrderReadyNotifyer`.

### What is missing?

The code largely works (I think? No tests to verify...).

The tests, however, are missing.

**TODO-list:**

1. Test-setup

- Database: Testcontainers Postgres
- AWS SQS and SNS: Testcontainers Localstack
- Payments provider: Wiremock
- Tweak config with correct values

2. [OrderRepositoryTes](src/test/kotlin/no/liflig/bartenderservice/orders/OrderRepositoryTest.kt) needs some assertions.

- AssertJ
- verifyJsonSnapshot

3. [ApiEndToEndTest](src/test/kotlin/no/liflig/bartenderservice/ApiEndToEndTest.kt) needs some assertions.

- RestAssured
- verifyJsonSnapshot

4. [OrderProcessingEndToEndTest](src/test/kotlin/no/liflig/bartenderservice/OrderProcessingEndToEndTest.kt) needs some
   input and assertions.

- Inspect the SNS published messages: Awaitility + http client + localstack API
- Storage: database SELECT
- Payment provider: Wiremock verify
- Inspect SQS available messages count == 0

See the docs in [docs/](docs/index.md) for references on testing-llibraries used.

## Getting started

### Tool dependencies

You need to install:

- Docker
- Maven (or run maven through IntelliJ)
- JDK 17
  - `brew tap homebrew/cask-versions` and then`brew install --cask temurin17`

### Developer machine setup

#### Git Clone

```shell
git clone git@github.com:krissrex/capra-e2e-testing-kotlin-backend-course.git
```

**IntelliJ** ‚Üí `File` ‚Üí `New` ‚Üí `Project from existing sources...` ‚Üí `capra-e2e-testing-kotlin-backend-course`.

Choose _"Import project from external model"_ and select `Maven`.

## Running the application

Run `./init-local-env.sh` once to create `overrides.properties` to tweak settings.

Start [Main.kt](src/main/kotlin/no/liflig/bartenderservice/Main.kt).
You should use `./scripts/build.sh`, then `./scripts/run.sh` or `./scripts/run-docker.sh`.
Or run `no.liflig.bartenderservice.Main.main()` from IntelliJ.

The app needs a Postgres database, an SQS message queue, and an SNS pub/sub topic.

### Building a dockerfile (optional)

1. Build the jar: `mvn package`
2. Copy the jar from `target/app.jar` to `/docker/app.jar`.

- You can use `./scripts/build.sh`.

3. Run the app

- Start `docker-compose`:
   ```shell
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```
- Or `./scripts/run-docker.sh`

You can test the API with [src/test/http/menu.http](src/test/http/menu.http)

### Sending test data

```shell
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=x AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=x aws --region=us-east-1 --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 sqs send-message --queue-url=http://localstack:4566/000000000000/orders-queue --message-body '{"orderId":"1","customer":{"id":"1","age":"TWENTY"},"paymentInfo":{"cardNumber":"123-1234-123-456"},"orderLines":[{"id":"1","name":"Hansa","price":"98","size":"0.6","ageLimit":"EIGHTEEN"},{"id":"4","name":"Hakkespett","price":"120","size":"0.4","ageLimit":"TWENTY"}]}'
```

or

```shell
awslocal sqs send-message --queue-url=http://localstack:4566/000000000000/orders-queue --message-body '{"orderId":"1","customer":{"id":"1","age":"TWENTY"},"paymentInfo":{"cardNumber":"123-1234-123-456"},"orderLines":[{"id":"1","name":"Hansa","price":"98","size":"0.6","ageLimit":"EIGHTEEN"},{"id":"4","name":"Hakkespett","price":"120","size":"0.4","ageLimit":"TWENTY"}]}'
```

## Running tests

```shell
mvn verify
```

Add `-DskipTests` to `mvn` to disable all tests.
Add `-DskipITs` to only disable integration tests.

## Linting

Only lint: `mvn spotless:check`

Fix: `mvn spotless:apply`
